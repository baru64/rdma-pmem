subnet is configured and managed by subnet manager
sm - centralized, configures hosts
- assigns ports Local Identifier (LID)

rdma send
- from one or multiple buffers to one or multiple buffers

work request WR
- items that the hw should perform

work completion
- when wr completed, creates Work Completion
- type, opcode, amount of data, more

work queue
- contrains WRs
- scheduled by the hw
- can be either send or receive queue
- adding a wr to a wq is called 'posting a wr'
- ewery wr is 'outstanding' until it ends with WC, while outstanding: one cannot know if it was scheduled or not, send buffers cannot be freed/reused, receive buffers content is undetermined


send queue SQ
- entries - send request SR, specifies:
  - how data is used, what mem buffers to use, opcode, amount of data

recv queue (RQ)
- handles incoming msgs
- receive request RR, specifies mem buffers to be used
- rq may send data as a response - depends on opcode

queue pair QP
- unifies both send and receive queues
- every queue is independent
- every qp is associated with a partition key P_Key

roles:
- requester - active side
- responder - passive side - sends or receives data
  - may post RR
  - send ack/nack in reliable transport
